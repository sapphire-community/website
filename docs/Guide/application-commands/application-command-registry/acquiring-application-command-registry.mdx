title: Acquiring an Application Command Registry
---

To do anything with the [`Application Command Registry`][acr] we need to "acquire" one. To "acquire" an
[`Application Command Registry`][acr] means to retrieve an already existing one for the command name you specify or
generating a brand new one. This may sound more complicated than it actually is, so bare with us here. Acquiring an
[`Application Command Registry`][acr] can be done in two ways:

- By calling the `ApplicationCommandRegistries.acquire` method
- By using the [`registerApplicationCommands`][register-application-commands] method of the [`Command`][command] class
  (which receives a pre-defined registry for the command it's present in)

## `Command#registerApplicationCommands`

This method is present inside of the [`Command`][command] class and can be used to acquire the command's
[`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][acr] and use it directly. Let's see a quick example of how to use it:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{4-6}|{4-6}
import { ApplicationCommandRegistry, Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: ApplicationCommandRegistry) {
    // registry is specifically for the "ping" command
  }
}
```

This means that this registry will only concern itself about the current `ping` command - it's not going to impact any
other commands.

## `ApplicationCommandRegistries.acquire`

:::caution

For most use cases the method above should suffice. Acquiring the [`Application Command Registry`][acr] through
`ApplicationCommandRegistries.acquire` should be considered advanced. An example usage of this is consolidating all the
registering outside of the command, or creating TypeScript decorators for registering.

:::

This method is used to acquire the application command registry by it's name. It will return the application command
registry for command name provided.

If command name is already registered in the registry then it will return the existing registry else it will create a
new and then returns it. Let's see an example of how to use it:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{4}|{4}
import { ApplicationCommandRegistries } from '@sapphire/framework';

// Gets the registry for a command with the name of "ping"
const pingRegistry = ApplicationCommandRegistries.acquire('ping');
```

It returns a [`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][acr] for the command name provided, which can be used to perform operations
on the registry for this command.

## What's next?

Now that we have learned how the acquire the [`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][acr] we can start registering commands. To
