title: Acquiring an Application Command Registry
---

To do anything with the `Application Command Registry` we need to acquire the one for the use. It can be done in two
ways:

- By calling the `ApplicationCommandRegistries.acquire` method or,
- By using the [`registerApplicationCommands`][register-application-commands] method of the `Command` class

### `ApplicationCommandRegistries.acquire`

This method is used to acquire the application command registry by it's name. It will return the application command
registry for command name provided.

If command name is already registered in the registry then it will return the existing registry else it will create a
new and then returns the same. Let's see an example of how to use it:

`Example`

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{4}|{4}
import { ApplicationCommandRegistries } from '@sapphire/framework';

// Gets the registry for a command with the name of "ping"
const pingRegistry = ApplicationCommandRegistries.acquire('ping');
```

It returns the [`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][application-command-registry] for the command name provided and then later
on it can be used to perform the operations on the registry for the command.

### `Command.registerApplicationCommands`

This method is present inside the [`Command`][command] class and can be used to acquire the command registry for the
respective class. It returns the application command registry which is associated with the command class. Let's see a
quick example of how to use it:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{4-6}|{4-6}
import { ApplicationCommandRegistry, Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: ApplicationCommandRegistry) {
    // registry is specifically for the "ping" command
  }
}
```

The method returns the [`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][application-command-registry] for the command class and is
specifically for the class in which it's called.
