title: Registering Chat Input Commands
---

This is to cover:
- guildIds and what they
- registerCommandIfMissing
- behaviorWhenNotIdentical (in a tip admonition link to the advanced page for configuring the global behavior)
- idHints and why they are important

- Add an admonition linking to aquiring an application command registry
- registerChatInputCommand
- addChatInputCommandNames and when it is useful (mention how it does not register to discord but only add to sapphire store)
- addChatInputCommandIs and when it is useful
- And finally the actual registering part **inside the command**
