## Before you start

It is important to note that the primary breaking change of Sapphire v4 is support for DiscordJS v14.x. This means that
for the bulk of the breaking changes we want to refer you to [Updating from v13 to v14][djs-migration].

## Sapphire specific changes

Sapphire has a few breaking changes that are not related to DiscordJS. These are:

- The [`Identifiers`][Identifiers] enum was changed from `const enum` to [`enum`][enum].
- The [`CommandOptionsRunTypeEnum`][CommandOptionsRunTypeEnum] enum was changed from `const enum` to [`enum`][enum].
- The [`CommandPreConditions`][CommandPreConditions] enum was changed from `const enum` to [`enum`][enum].
- The [`InteractionHandlerTypes`][InteractionHandlerTypes] enum was changed from `const enum` to [`enum`][enum].
- The [`InternalRegistryAPIType`][InternalRegistryAPIType] enum was changed from `const enum` to [`enum`][enum].
- The [`LogLevel`][LogLevel] enum was changed from `const enum` to [`enum`][enum].
- The [`PreconditionRunMode`][PreconditionRunMode] enum was changed from `const enum` to [`enum`][enum].
- The type [`Command.ChatInputInteraction`][ChatInputInteraction] enum was changed to
  [`Command.ChatInputCommandInteraction`][ChatInputCommandInteraction].
- The type [`Command.ContextMenuInteraction`][ContextMenuInteraction] enum was changed to
  [`Command.ContextMenuCommandInteraction`][ContextMenuCommandInteraction].
- The `default_permission` option for Application Commands has been removed to match the removal on the discord.js and
  Discord API side.
