If you are using localhost as your test environment, make sure you use http://127.0.0.1 instead of http://localhost in
your browser otherwise you may encounter problems with the cookie setting successfully.

If you want your bot to have a web dashboard, you need to implement OAUTH2 authentication. This is a way for users to
log in to your bot's website using their Discord account.

In order to implement this using Sapphire's built-in OAUTH2 feature, you will need to define OAUTH2 information within
the `api` options in the [`ClientOptions`]:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{6-11}
import { SapphireClient } from '@sapphire/framework';
import { OAuth2Scopes } from 'discord.js';

const client = new SapphireClient({
  api: {
    auth: {
      id: 'BOT_CLIENT_ID',
      secret: 'BOT_CLIENT_SECRET',
      scopes: [OAuth2Scopes.Identify, OAuth2Scopes.Guilds],
      cookie: 'SAPPHIRE_AUTH',
      domainOverwrite: '127.0.0.1'
    }
  }
});
```

:::warning

The [`domainOverwrite`][domainOverwrite] option is only required for your local testing environment where you need to
use the `127.0.0.1` domain as mentioned above. The reason for this is that while we attempt to resolve the domain for
you, `127.0.0.1` as a fully qualify IPv4 address is unique in that as a domain it would resolve to `0.1`
(`domain.top-level-domain` format).

You should either remove it when deploying to production, or make it dynamic in some way (i.e. by using environment
variables or a ternary if statement)

:::info

In the code block above we specify the OAUTH2 scopes that we want. The default of the plugin is only
[`OAuth2Scopes.Identify`][oauth2-identify], which means that no guild data will be fetched. Because we are creating a
settings web dashboard we do want guild data, therefore we add the [`Guilds`][oauth2-guilds] OAUTH2 scope. For more
information on OAUTH2 scopes see [the discord developer documentation][discord-dev-oauth2scopes]

:::

Once you have done this, we can leverage the built-in `/oauth/callback` route to handle the OAUTH2 callback and retrieve
the [`LoginData`] from the Discord API. The specific data we get back depends on the scopes defined in our
[`ClientOptions`] - in our case, we used the `identify` and the `guilds` scope, so we'll get both [`LoginData.user`] and
[`LoginData.guilds`].

The next step is to implement the frontend part of the OAUTH2 process. This is covered on the next page.
