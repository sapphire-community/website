title: Getting started with Sapphire
---

When installing the Sapphire Framework, you need to install both discord.js and @sapphire/framework. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash npm2yarn2pnpm
npm install @sapphire/framework discord.js
```

:::caution
You need at least Node.js version 16.6.0 to use Sapphire.

## Creating an `index.js` file

While it doesn't have to be called `index.js`, this file is the main file for your bot, which will handle the bot's setup and login. It is recommended to put this inside a folder, such as `src`, both for the cleanliness for your code, as well as for [Creating Commands](creating-a-basic-command).

:::caution
Make sure that the `main` property in your `package.json` points to the right path, such as `src/index.js`.
:::

To begin, require `@sapphire/framework` and create a new [`SapphireClient`][sapphire]. This is where you can customize Sapphire's and discord.js' behaviour. The Sapphire client extends discord.js', so everything from [`Client`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client) is available in [`SapphireClient`][sapphire]!

```

</TabItem>

Sapphire will detect a mention prefix (`@bot command`), but you can optionally define a default prefix (or prefixes) with the `defaultPrefix` option, as well as `regexPrefix` if you are familiar with regexes.

There is also the advanced option [`baseUserDirectory`](../../Documentation/api-framework/interfaces/SapphireClientOptions#baseuserdirectory), which allows you to define the base directory for Sapphire to scan. By default, Sapphire will register this as the directory where your `main` file is at, joined by the store's name. As such, if the root directory is `src`, it will register `src/commands` as one of the command directories.

:::danger
You should use environment variables or a `config.json` for your token instead of passing it directly!
You can read more about why you should [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#your-token).
:::

And that's it for your `index.js` file! In the end, your file structure should look like this, along with whatever `.gitignore` or `config.json` files you may have:

```bash {4}
├── node_modules
├── package.json
└── src
    └── index.js
```
