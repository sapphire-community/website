title: Registering Context Commands
---

On the page [Registering Chat Input Commands][rcic] we have learned how to register a Chat Input Command and how to
assign options to those commands. However there is another another type of command, Context Menu Commands.

Context Menu Commands show up as the name implies, in the context menu. The specific menus are those when right clicking
a user, and those when right clicking a message.

Message Context Menu Commands look like this:

And User Context Menu Commands look like this:

## How to register a Message Context Menu Command

The easiest way to register a Message Context Menu Command is to implement the [`registerApplicationCommands`][rac]
method on a [`Command`][command] class. In that method the first parameter is the [`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][acr]
(commonly called `registry` in code) on which you can call [`registerContextMenuCommand`][rcmc]. This looks like:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{8,11-17}|{8,11-17}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';
import { ApplicationCommandType } from 'discord-api-types/v9';

export class SlashCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      description: 'Delete message and ban author.'
    });
  }

  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: Command.Registry) {
    registry.registerContextMenuCommand((builder) =>
      builder //
        .setName(this.name)
        .setType(ApplicationCommandType.Message)
    );
  }

  public override contextMenuRun(interaction: Command.ContextMenuInteraction) {
    // Use `isMessageContextMenu` to ensure this command was executed as a Message Context Menu Command.
    if (interaction.isMessageContextMenu()) {
    }
  }
}
```

:::info

We use `//` next to `builder //` here to short-circuit Prettier putting everything on the same line. If you do not use
prettier you can remove this, or if you do not care for it being on the same line then you can remove it also.

:::

In this code snippet we have registered the Message Context Menu Command in the most simple way referencing the already
defined `name`. It should be noted that as opposed to [Chat Input Commands][rcic] it is not possible for Context Menu
Commands to hold a description. We also use the [`builder`][djs-slash-builder-docs] pattern which means you get
verification of your input before a command gets registered in a faulty way. It will also make sure that you are not
providing unnecessary or incorrect JSON keys because you're not building the JSON yourself. All that said, it is the
method we recommend everyone to use. If you are experienced with Context Menu Command you can also opt to write your own
raw JSON object, however this guide will not cover that.

In the code snippet above we passed 1 parameter to the [`registerContextMenuCommand`][rcmc] method, to build the object
that gets send to Discord for registering the command. The [`registerContextMenuCommand`][rcmc] however also takes a
second parameter. This is identical to the second parameter of the [`registerChatInputCommand`][rcic] method, so for
information on that please look at [Chat Input Command Registry Options][cicro].

## How to register a User Context Menu Command

Registering User Context Menu Commands is very similar to Message Context Menu Commands. The only difference is that you
have to specify the different type in the registry. Some example code for this is:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{8,11-17}|{8,11-17}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';
import { ApplicationCommandType } from 'discord-api-types/v9';

export class SlashCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      description: 'Ban user.'
    });
  }

  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: Command.Registry) {
    registry.registerContextMenuCommand((builder) =>
      builder //
        .setName(this.name)
        .setType(ApplicationCommandType.User)
    );
  }

  public override contextMenuRun(interaction: Command.ContextMenuInteraction) {
    // Use `isUserContextMenu` to ensure this command was executed as a User Context Menu Command.
    if (interaction.isUserContextMenu()) {
    }
  }
}
```

## Context Menu Command Registry Methods

:::warning

To register a context menu input command, you need to acquire the [`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][acr]. Please see the
[`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][aaacr] section for more details.

:::

### `registerContextMenuCommand`

The method which is responsible for telling the registry that this command should be registered. It takes two
parameters:

- `command`: The Context Menu Command data to be registered. This can be a `discord.js`
  [`ApplicationCommandData`][djs-command-data-docs] object a `@discordjs/builders`
  [`ContextMenuCommandBuilder`][djs-context-menu-command-builder-docs] or a method which returns the
  `@discordjs/builders `[`ContextMenuCommandBuilder`][djs-context-menu-command-builder-docs].

  For more details on how to use
  `@discordjs/builders `[`ContextMenuCommandBuilder`][djs-context-menu-command-builder-docs], please see
  [`discord.js guide`][djs-context-menu-command-builder-docs].

- `options` These are optional registry [`options`][cicro] you can provide when registering the command you provided. By
  default, this is set to `{ behaviorWhenNotIdentical: RegisterBehavior.Overwrite }`.

An example of this method was shown above at [How to register a Message Context Menu Command][inner-ref-how-to].

### `addContextMenuCommandNames`

The command names which let the registry know that these names should trigger the registry. These names doesn't register
the command but only let the registry know that these names should trigger the command, i.e. the names are only stored
in command store to be used by the registry. Names can be passed as strings.

### `addContextMenuCommandIds`

The command ids that informs the registry to trigger it for the specified ids only. Ids can be passed as strings.

:::warning

`addContextMenuCommandNames` or `addContextMenuCommandIds` should only be used when you don't want `Sapphire` to manage
the application commands automatically for you else consider using `idHints` instead.

Whenever the `addContextMenuCommandIds` method is called with an invalid id (we expect a string that can be turned into
a BigInt), then it will **ALWAYS** warn in the console. No, this cannot be turned off.

:::

## Full Example

Now that we have covered everything there is to registering a Context Menu Command lets look at how a full example could
look like. This builds on the examples provided above while also implementing the `contextMenuRun` method to ban the
user.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';
import { ApplicationCommandType } from 'discord-api-types/v9';
import { Formatters, GuildMember } from 'discord.js';

export class SlashCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      description: 'Ban user.'
    });
  }

  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: Command.Registry) {
    registry.registerContextMenuCommand((builder) =>
      builder //
        .setName(this.name)
        .setType(ApplicationCommandType.User)
    );
  }

  public override async contextMenuRun(interaction: Command.ContextMenuInteraction) {
    // Use `isUserContextMenu` to ensure this command was executed as a User Context Menu Command.
    if (interaction.isUserContextMenu() && interaction.targetMember instanceof GuildMember) {
      await interaction.targetMember.ban({
        days: 8,
        reason: 'Banned for for breaking the rules.'
      });

      const userToGreetMention = Formatters.userMention(interaction.targetMember.id);

      return interaction.reply({
        content: `${userToGreetMention} has been successfully banned`,
        allowedMentions: {
          users: [interaction.targetMember.id]
        }
      });
    }
  }
}
```
