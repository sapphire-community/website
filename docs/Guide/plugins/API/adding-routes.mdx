title: How to add routes
sidebar_position: 1

First we create a new folder called `routes` in the `src` directory. And make a new file `hello-world.get`

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { Route } from '@sapphire/plugin-api';

export class UserRoute extends Route {
  public run(_request: Route.Request, response: Route.Response) {
    response.json({ message: 'Hello World' });
  }
}
```

A quick glance on what we did above:

- First we extended the `Route` class to make our route
- Second we defined the handler for the `GET` method defined in the filename
- Finally, when `GET /hello-world` is called, the route will reply with the defined body
