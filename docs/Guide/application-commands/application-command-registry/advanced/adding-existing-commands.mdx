title: Adding existing application commands to the registry
---

Alternatively, if you don't want to let Sapphire handle registering for you (ðŸ˜¢), you already have commands registered
through other means, or are not planning on changing the commands ever, you can just give the registry the ids or names
(but read [about registering outside the command class](registering-outside-command-class) first) that the command class
should handle, and we'll properly direct everything where it should be directed.

## Adding inside of the command class

In the `Command` class, there's a method that you can define called `registerApplicationCommands`. It receives an
`ApplicationCommandRegistry` which you can use to add a name or id.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { ApplicationCommandRegistry, Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class UwUCommand extends Command {
  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: ApplicationCommandRegistry) {
    // Adding a name
    // NOT RECOMMENDED. Use the id methods with ids instead.
    registry.addChatInputCommandNames('uwu');

    // Adding an id
    // For this example, the id is fake. In your code, you should provide valid ids.
    registry.addChatInputCommandIds('123456789123456789');
  }
}
```

## Adding outside of the command class

If you're outside of a command class, you'll have to manually acquire the registry first, and then add the ids or names
to it. It'll look really similar to what we did in order
[to register outside the class](registering-outside-command-class). If you're confused on what the registry is, you can
[read up on how it works][acquiring-application-command-registry].

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { ApplicationCommandRegistries } from '@sapphire/framework';

const registry = ApplicationCommandRegistries.acquire('uwu');

// Adding a name
// NOT RECOMMENDED. Use the id methods with ids instead.
registry.addChatInputCommandNames('uwu');

// Adding an id
// For this example, this id is fake. In your code, you should provide valid ids.
registry.addChatInputCommandIds('123456789123456789');
```
