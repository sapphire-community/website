title: Acquiring an Application Command Registry
---

To work with an application command registry, you must "acquire" one for your commands. We can do this by using the
pre-defined registry for a command through the [`registerApplicationCommands`][register-application-commands] method
argument of the [`Command`][command] class.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{4-6}
import { ApplicationCommandRegistry, Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: ApplicationCommandRegistry) {
    // registry is unique to this command
  }
}
```

Acquiring and accessing the application command registry this way is only associated with `PingCommand` - it will not
interact with any other of your commands.

:::warning

For most users, the method above should suffice. Another way of acquiring an application command registry is through
`ApplicationCommandRegistries.acquire()`, but it should only be chosen for advanced usage such as handling application
command registration outside a command or creating TypeScript decorators.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{4}|{4}
import { ApplicationCommandRegistries } from '@sapphire/framework';

// Acquires the registry keyed by 'ping'
const pingRegistry = ApplicationCommandRegistries.acquire('ping');
```
