title: Handling permissions
---

One of the most basic needs of a Discord bot is to be able to deny command access to users based on their permissions or
lack thereof. A common example would be moderation commands. Most people wouldn't want regular users to be able to ban
people, so we can restrict usage using the [`requiredUserPermissions`][requireduserpermissions] option.

<!-- TODO: info block redirecting to subcommands ts guide for using corresponding decorators -->

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{7}|{7}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';
import { PermissionFlagsBits } from 'discord.js';

export class BanCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context) {
    super(context, {
      // ...
      requiredUserPermissions: [PermissionFlagsBits.BanMembers]
    });
  }
}
```

Users without the "Ban Members" permission will now be unable to use the command!

## Handling Client Permissions

It's also a good idea to verify the inverse: does the _bot_ have the "Ban Members" permission? We can use the
[`requiredClientPermissions`][requiredclientpermissions] option the same way to prevent the command from being used if
not.

<!-- TODO: info block redirecting to subcommands ts guide for using corresponding decorators -->

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{8}|{8}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';
import { PermissionFlagsBits } from 'discord.js';

export class BanCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context) {
    super(context, {
      // ...
      requiredUserPermissions: [PermissionFlagsBits.BanMembers],
      requiredClientPermissions: [PermissionFlagsBits.BanMembers]
    });
  }
}
```

With these changes, `BanCommand` now requires the command executor _and_ the client to have the "Ban Members" permission
to execute!
