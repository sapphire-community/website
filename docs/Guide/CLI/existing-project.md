If you used Sapphire CLI to create your project, you can skip this.

:::

```shell:no-line-numbers
$ sapphire init
```

Run this command to start.

```shell:no-line-numbers{2-4}

Choose a format for your config file, we will choose **YAML** in this guide. This config file is for Sapphire CLI, read
more about it here.

```shell:no-line-numbers{3-5}
$ sapphire init
‚úî What format do you want your config file to be in? ‚Ä∫ YAML
? Choose the language used in your project ‚Ä∫ - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.

? Where do you store your preconditions? (do not include the base) ‚Ä∫ preconditions
```

Enter your preconditions directory, where your preconditions are located (don't include the base), defaults to

```shell:no-line-numbers{9}
$ sapphire init

Choose if you want to enable custom file (piece) templates, type `y` and enter if you want to enable it. If you don't
want to enable it, just enter.

```shell:no-line-numbers
$ sapphire init
