title: What are preconditions and how do they work?
---

Preconditions are classes that will determine whether or not a command should be ran according to certain conditions.
Sapphire has many built in preconditions ready for use that are outlined in the coming pages, such as for [creating
cooldowns][creating-cooldowns], [restricting channel types][restricting-channel-types], [handling
permissions][handling-permissions], and [filtering nsfw channels][nsfw-filter]. However, we also provide an easy system
for you to create your own preconditions, which you can learn how to use on the next page.

[creating-cooldowns]: ./command-cooldown
[restricting-channel-types]: ./channel-types
[handling-permissions]: ./handling-permissions
[nsfw-filter]: ./nsfw-filter
