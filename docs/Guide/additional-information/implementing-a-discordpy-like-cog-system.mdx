title: Implementing a discord.py like Cog system
---

Developer who come from the Python ecosystem may be familiar with the "[Cog]" system that discord.py has implemented.
This system allows you to group commands, listeners and other pieces into a [Cog] (also sometimes called "module"),
which can then be loaded and unloaded as a whole. This is a useful system for large bots, as it allows you to easily
split your code into multiple files, and only load the parts you need.

While Sapphire does not natively have a built-in [Cog] system, it is possible to implement one yourself. This guide will
teach you how to do this.

For this guide we will register an `audio` cog which will have commands and listeners related to playing music through
your bot. This cog will be called `audio` and have subfolders of `commands` and `listeners`. That is to say, the general
structure of your bot will be something like this:

```bash {4-10}
├── node_modules
├── package.json
└── src
    ├── audio
    │   ├── commands
    │   │   ├── play.ts
    │   │   └── stop.ts
    │   └── listeners
    │       ├── audioStarted.ts
    │       └── audioStopped.ts
    └── index.ts
```

The best way to ensure that Sapphire will register this `audio` folder and all store folders under it is by first
extending the [`SapphireClient`] and overloading the constructor:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{3-7}|{4-8}
import { SapphireClient } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { ClientOptions } from 'discord.js';

export class MyOverloadedClient extends SapphireClient {
  public constructor(options: ClientOptions) {
    super(options);
  }
}
```

Next, we need to register the path for the `audio` folder. We only need to register this parent folder, we not need to
subsequently also register the `commands`, `listeners`, etc folders that reside within it. We can do this by using the
[`registerPath`] method of a [`StoreRegistry`]. Here we use the [`getRootData`] method from `@sapphire/pieces` which is
also the method that Sapphire uses internally to determine the base folder where the stores are (i.e. `dist` for
TypeScript users, `src` for JavaScript users). We then use this the result of this [`getRootData`] function to join the
root folder with the folder name `audio`, which will handle the registering of the folder.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{2,6,11}|{2,7,12}
import { SapphireClient } from '@sapphire/framework';
import { getRootData } from '@sapphire/pieces';
import type { ClientOptions } from 'discord.js';
import { join } from 'node:path';

export class MyOverloadedClient extends SapphireClient {
  private rootData = getRootData();

  public constructor(options: ClientOptions) {
    super(options);

    this.stores.registerPath(join(this.rootData.root, 'audio'));
  }
}
```

Once the `audio` folder is registered this way, Sapphire will automatically register all the store folder under it. That
is to say, pieces in `audio/commands` will be parsed as commands, pieces in `audio/listeners` will be parsed as
listeners, etc.
