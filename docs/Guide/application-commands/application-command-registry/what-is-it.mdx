Application command registry is the core hub for managing all operations related to application commands. It handles the
new command registration, to keep commands in sync with the Discord API, and to point the right
[`commandIds`][commandids] and names to the right [`Command`][command] class.

It has some important methods regarding the commands registration and it's behavior. We will see how to use them in the
next sections.
