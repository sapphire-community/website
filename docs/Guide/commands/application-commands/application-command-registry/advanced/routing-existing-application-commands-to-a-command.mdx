title: Routing existing Application Commands to a Command
---

If you want to route existing or multiple other application commands to one of your commands, or just don't want
Sapphire handling application command registering for you (ðŸ˜¢), you can provide the ids or names (not recommended) of
application commands to a command's application command registry and we'll properly route invocations to the command.

Most users will probably be fine using the `idHints` option of [`registerChatInputCommand`][rcic] or
[`registerContextmenuCommand`][rcmc], see the section in [Registering Chat Input Commands][idhints] for more details.

:::info

As a friendly reminder, Discord manages "Application Command Objects" on their end for each of your application
commands. Whenever your bot registers a new application command with Discord, they create and store a new object like
this:

```json
{
  "id": "1223334444555554444",
  "application_id": "...",
  // ...
  "name": "foo",
  "description": "bar!"
}
```

When we say "...Provide X from Application Command Objects..." below, what we mean is to copy the field X from the
Application Command Object(s) corresponding to the application command(s) you want Sapphire to route to your command.

## Application Command Registry Methods

### [`addChatInputCommandIds(...)`][addchatinputcommandids]

Provide id(s) from Application Command Objects that identify the application commands you want to route to this command.

:::warning

Whenever the `addContextMenuCommandIds` method is called with an invalid id (we expect a string that can be turned into
a BigInt), then it will **ALWAYS** log a warning in the console. No, this cannot be turned off.

:::

### [`addChatInputCommandNames(...)`][addchatinputcommandnames]

Provide names from Application Command Objects that identify the application commands you want to route to this command.

### [`addContextMenuCommandIds(...)`][addcontextmenucommandids]

Same as [`addChatInputCommandIds`][addchatinputcommandids] but for context menu commands

### [`addContextMenuCommandNames(...)`][addcontextmenucommandnames]

Same as [`addChatInputCommandNames`][addchatinputcommandnames] but for context menu commands

## Adding from inside a command

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { ApplicationCommandRegistry, Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class UwUCommand extends Command {
  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: ApplicationCommandRegistry) {
    // Adding a name
    // NOT RECOMMENDED. Use the id methods with ids instead.
    registry.addChatInputCommandNames('uwu');

    // Adding an id
    // For this example, the id is fake. In your code, you should provide valid ids.
    registry.addChatInputCommandIds('123456789123456789');
  }
}
```

## Adding from outside a command

If you're outside of a command class, you'll have to manually acquire the registry first, and then add the ids or names
to it. It'll look really similar to what we did in [Registering Application Commands outside a
Command][registering-outside-command-class].

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { ApplicationCommandRegistries } from '@sapphire/framework';

const registry = ApplicationCommandRegistries.acquire('uwu');

// Adding a name
// NOT RECOMMENDED. Use the id methods with ids instead.
registry.addChatInputCommandNames('uwu');

// Adding an id
// For this example, this id is fake. In your code, you should provide valid ids.
registry.addChatInputCommandIds('123456789123456789');
```
