title: Built-in arguments
---

:::tip

These can be used anytime with the `Args` class, and can be accessed via `container.stores.get('arguments')`.

:::

:::warning Overriding

If you define an `Argument` with the same name as a built-in one, e.g. [`boolean` ↗️][boolean], the one you define will
replace the built-in one. This applies to all other stores from the framework and plugins.

:::
