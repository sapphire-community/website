title: Registering custom paths for a store
---

While Sapphire sets specific folder names for the stores, you may want to use different folder names. Sapphire enables
you to have this level of customization, and we will cover how to achieve this on this page.

For this guide we will use the store `interaction-handlers` as an example as it is one store name that even when we
implemented it, we had a long open discussion with the community on how we would name this store. We switched between
just `handlers` or `interactionHandlers`, to eventually `interaction-handlers`.

Lets say we want Sapphire to also recognise the folder named `handlers`. To make sure Sapphire does this, we need to
register the folder path for the store. The best way to do this is by first extending the [`SapphireClient`] and
overloading the constructor:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{3-7}|{4-8}
import { SapphireClient } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { ClientOptions } from 'discord.js';

export class MyOverloadedClient extends SapphireClient {
  public constructor(options: ClientOptions) {
    super(options);
  }
}
```

Next, we need to register the folder path for the store. We can do this by using the [`registerPath`] method of a
[`Store`]. Here we use the [`getRootData`] method from `@sapphire/pieces` which is also the method that Sapphire uses
internally to determine the base folder where the stores are (i.e. `dist` for TypeScript users, `src` for JavaScript
users). We then use this the result of this [`getRootData`] function to join the root folder with the folder name
`interaction`, which will handle the registering of the folder.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{2,6,11}|{2,7,12}
import { SapphireClient } from '@sapphire/framework';
import { getRootData } from '@sapphire/pieces';
import type { ClientOptions } from 'discord.js';
import { join } from 'node:path';

export class MyOverloadedClient extends SapphireClient {
  private rootData = getRootData();

  public constructor(options: ClientOptions) {
    super(options);

    this.stores.get('interaction-handlers').registerPath(join(this.rootData.root, 'interactions'));
  }
}
```

Once the `interactions` folder is registered this way, Sapphire will automatically also load [`InteractionHandler`]
classes from this folder.
