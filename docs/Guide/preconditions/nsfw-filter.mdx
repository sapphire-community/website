title: Locking commands to NSFW channels
---

Sometimes it can be necessary to lock certain commands to NSFW (not safe for work) channels. This can be simply achieved
by setting the `nsfw` option in the command.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{7}|{7}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class NSFWCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context) {
    super(context, {
      // ...
      nsfw: true
    });
  }
}
```
