title: How to add routes

First we create a new folder called `routes` in the `src` directory. And make a new file `hello-world`

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { methods, Route, type ApiRequest, type ApiResponse } from '@sapphire/plugin-api';

export class UserRoute extends Route {
  public constructor(context: Route.Context, options: Route.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      route: 'hello-world'
    });
  }

  public [methods.GET](_request: ApiRequest, response: ApiResponse) {
    response.json({ message: 'Hello World' });
  }

  public [methods.POST](_request: ApiRequest, response: ApiResponse) {
    response.json({ message: 'Hello World' });
  }
}
```

A quick glance on what we did above:

- First we extended the `Route` class to make our route
- Second we specified the route name in the constructor
- Third we defined the GET method
- Finally we responded to the request with a message which we would be able to use later when we fetch the route
