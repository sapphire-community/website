## Creating a bot

```bash
$ sapphire new
```

Run this command to start.

```bash {2}
$ sapphire new
? What's the name of your project? ‚Ä∫ my-sapphire-bot
```

Choose a name for your project, that will also be the folder name for your project. Defaults to `my-sapphire-bot`.

```bash {3-5}
$ sapphire new
‚úî What's the name of your project? ‚Ä¶ my-sapphire-bot
? Choose a language for your project ‚Ä∫ - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
‚ùØ   TypeScript (Recommended)
    JavaScript
```

Choose a language for your project, we will choose **TypeScript** in this guide.

```bash {4-6}
$ sapphire new
‚úî What's the name of your project? ‚Ä¶ my-sapphire-bot
‚úî Choose a language for your project ‚Ä∫ TypeScript (Recommended)
? Choose a template for your project ‚Ä∫ - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
‚ùØ   Default template (Recommended)
    with Docker
```

Choose a template for your project, we will go with the **default template** in this guide.

```bash {5-7}
$ sapphire new
‚úî What's the name of your project? ‚Ä¶ my-sapphire-bot
‚úî Choose a language for your project ‚Ä∫ TypeScript (Recommended)
‚úî Choose a template for your project ‚Ä∫ Default template (Recommended)
? What format do you want your config file to be in? ‚Ä∫ - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    JSON
‚ùØ   YAML
```

Choose a format for your config file, we will choose **YAML** in this guide. This config file is for Sapphire CLI, read
more about it here.

```bash {6-8}
$ sapphire new
‚úî What's the name of your project? ‚Ä¶ my-sapphire-bot
‚úî Choose a language for your project ‚Ä∫ TypeScript (Recommended)
‚úî Choose a template for your project ‚Ä∫ Default template (Recommended)
‚úî What format do you want your config file to be in? ‚Ä∫ YAML
? What package manager do you want to use? ‚Ä∫ - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
‚ùØ   Yarn (Recommended)
    npm
```

Choose a package manager for your project, we will choose **Yarn** in this guide.

```bash {7}
$ sapphire new
‚úî What's the name of your project? ‚Ä¶ my-sapphire-bot
‚úî Choose a language for your project ‚Ä∫ TypeScript (Recommended)
‚úî Choose a template for your project ‚Ä∫ Default template (Recommended)
‚úî What format do you want your config file to be in? ‚Ä∫ YAML
‚úî What package manager do you want to use? ‚Ä∫ Yarn (Recommended)
? Do you want to create a git repository for this project? ‚Ä∫ (y/N)
```

Lastly, if you want to initialize a git repository in your project, type `y` and enter. If you don't want a git
repository in your project, just enter.

Now wait for the CLI to create your project and install the dependencies. This should take ~2 minutes.

```bash
$ sapphire new
‚úî What's the name of your project? ‚Ä¶ my-sapphire-bot
‚úî Choose a language for your project ‚Ä∫ TypeScript (Recommended)
‚úî Choose a template for your project ‚Ä∫ Default template (Recommended)
‚úî What format do you want your config file to be in? ‚Ä∫ YAML
‚úî What package manager do you want to use? ‚Ä∫ Yarn (Recommended)
‚úî Do you want to create a git repository for this project? ‚Ä¶ no
‚úî Cloning the repository
‚úî Setting up the project
‚úî Installing dependencies using Yarn
Done!
```
