title: Built-in arguments
---

:::tip
They can be used anytime with the `Args` class, and can be accessed via `container.stores.get('arguments')`.
:::

:::caution Overriding
If you define an `Argument` with the same name as a built-in one, e.g. [`boolean`][boolean],
the one you define will replace the built-in one.
This same mechanism applies to all other stores from the framework and plugins.
:::
