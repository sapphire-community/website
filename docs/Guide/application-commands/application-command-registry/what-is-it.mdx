When working with [application commands][discord-application-command-docs], Discord manages "Application Command
Objects" on their end for each of your application commands. Keeping things synced through their API directly, or even
through `discord.js` can be time-consuming and error-prone.

An [ApplicationCommandRegistry][application-command-registry] manages application command operations for **one** of your
bot's commands. It handles things such as syncing application command data with Discord, routing multiple application
commands to your command, and much more!
