title: Locking commands to NSFW channels
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Well, we know that our bot may have NSFW (Not Safe For Work) commands, and we don't want those commands to be used by
any member of the server! To avoid that in a simple way, we have an option called `nsfw` in the command options. This
option defaults to `false` but if you set it to `true` then the command will only run on channels marked as NSFW.

Let's see an example of how to configure this option, it is really simple.

<Tabs groupId="language-choice">
<TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript" default>

```javascript {4-11}
const { Command } = require('@sapphire/framework');

module.exports = class LewdCommand extends Command {
  constructor(context, options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      name: 'lewd',
      aliases: ['lewd'],
      description: 'lewd content',
      nsfw: true
    });
  }
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ESM" label="ESM">

```javascript {4-11}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class LewdCommand extends Command {
  constructor(context, options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      name: 'lewd',
      aliases: ['lewd'],
      description: 'lewd content',
      nsfw: true
    });
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

```typescript {5-9}
import { ApplyOptions } from '@sapphire/decorators';
import { Command, CommandOptions } from '@sapphire/framework';

@ApplyOptions<CommandOptions>({
  name: 'lewd',
  aliases: ['lewd'],
  description: 'lewd content',
  nsfw: true
})
export class LewdCommand extends Command {}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

And that's it, easy right? Now you can rest assured that your NSFW command will be executed only on channels marked as
NSFW, otherwise the `commandDenied` event will be executed. Remember that you can customize what message will be sent to
that server member by configuring a custom listener for the `commandDenied` event for that option.
