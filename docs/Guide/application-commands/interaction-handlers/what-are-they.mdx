title: What are they?
---

These are interaction handlers! A simple class you can extend to handle almost all the interactions you may receive in
your bot, in a simple, clean and abstract way.

They are located in the `interaction-handlers` folder in your bot (just like how you most likely have a `commands`
folder or a `listeners` folder). Same rules apply when it comes to loading and everything!

## How does it work?

When creating your interaction handler, you have to specify the type it is. Here are the current types available:

| Enum Name          | What it will run for                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Autocomplete]     | Autocomplete for interaction commands                                                |
| [Button]           | Button presses                                                                       |
| [ModalSubmit]      | Pop up modals                                                                        |
| [MessageComponent] | Any message **component** interactions received (Buttons and Select Menus currently) |
| [SelectMenu]       | Drop-down menus in messages                                                          |

These types define what the handler should get. For instance, specifying a `Button` interaction handler type will make
that handler receive **just** button interactions.

But that's not all! There's also a `parse` method which can be used for even more granular control (read below).

:::warning

By default, there is no filter for the `parse` method! This means you'll get all interactions of that type, and if you
want to override that (for example to only run that handler for certain ids), you'll want to override the `parse` method
in your code!

:::

## The `parse` method

When you're creating handlers, you may want to run certain handlers only when the custom id matches something you want.
In order to allow filtering, as well as optional additional pre-parsing of the custom id, we provide the `parse` method
on handlers, which you should override with your own code. The return of the `parse` method **must** be a `Some` /
`None`, which you can do with the provided shortcuts in the class: `this.some()` and `this.none()`.

:::info

Returning a `some` means that the handler's `run` method should be called. Returning a `none` means this handler should
be skipped for that interaction. If you've used our Args system, this might seem familiar with the `ok`/`err` that is
present there.

:::

What you return in the `some` is up to you! You can return nothing (be it null or undefined), a boolean, an object, a
class, a box of hugs, you name it! But, if the handler should run, you must return a `some` of some kind (you can use
the `this.some()` shortcut for it).

:::caution

If this function throws an error, the handler will be skipped and an `interactionHandlerParseError` event will be
emitted!

:::

### Couldn't you shove everything in the `parse` method?

The (sad) answer is... sort of.

You should not shove everything in the `parse` method. It is meant strictly for filtering the custom id or the data
received before actually working on it (for instance prefetching data from a database). It's done in this way to make
you abstract the validation from the processing of the interaction.

## Example `parse` methods

What you do in the parse method is up to you, however, we encourage keeping the parse method super simple and fast -
remember, you must reply to interactions in **at max 3 seconds!**

With that said, if you know your interaction handler in total will take more than 3 seconds to complete, you should call
the `deferReply` method in the `parse` method. That way, users will know your bot is processing instead of getting a
`The application did not respond in time` message.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { InteractionHandler, InteractionHandlerTypes } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class ParseExampleInteractionHandler extends InteractionHandler {
  public constructor(ctx) {
    super(ctx, { interactionHandlerType: InteractionHandlerTypes.Button });
  }

  // We'll look a little later in this guide on how to type this method, but for now, we'll type it as any.
  public async run(interaction: ButtonInteraction, awesomenessLevel: any) {
    // The `awesomenessLevel` variable has what we returned in the `parse` method's
    // `this.some`! In this example, we just show it to the user
    await interaction.reply({
      content: `Your awesomeness level is: **${awesomenessLevel}**`
    });
  }

  public parse(interaction: ButtonInteraction) {
    // If the custom id does not start with `is-user-awesome`, we do not want this
    // handler to run.
    if (!interaction.customId.startsWith('is-user-awesome')) return this.none();

    // Here we return a `Some` as said above, in this case passing 9001 to it
    // which we get back in the `run` method as the awesomneness level
    return this.some(9001);
  }
}
```

This is only an example of what you can use the parse method for - custom id filtering. You can do much more - as seen
below - like prefetching data from your database, or running long tasks, or whatever you want!

## Example `parse` method with deferring a long task

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { InteractionHandler, InteractionHandlerTypes } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class ExampleParseMethod extends InteractionHandler {
  public constructor(ctx) {
    super(ctx, { interactionHandlerType: InteractionHandlerTypes.Button });
  }

  public async run(interaction: ButtonInteraction, result: { success: boolean }) {
    await interaction.editReply({
      content: `The long running task ${result.success ? 'succeeded' : 'failed'}!`
    });
  }

  public async parse(interaction: ButtonInteraction) {
    if (!interaction.customId.startsWith('long-running-task')) return this.none();

    // Defer the interaction here as what we will do might take some time
    await interaction.deferReply();

    const result = await fetchDataThatMightTakeALongWhile(interaction.customId);

    return this.some(result);
  }
}
```

As you can see above, you can also use async / await to do anything that may need a promise. Do keep in mind the 3
second initial response limit! If you don't know how long your `parse` method will take to complete, please make sure to
defer your reply (an example can be seen above) before proceeding!

## How do we actually use all of this?

I'm glad you asked! Here's an example that handles all button presses and returns the "ping" (the delay from the moment
the button was pressed until the moment you received it)

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { InteractionHandler, InteractionHandlerTypes, PieceContext } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { ButtonInteraction } from 'discord.js';
import type { Project } from '@prisma/client';

export class HowDoWeUseThemExample extends InteractionHandler {
  public constructor(ctx: PieceContext) {
    super(ctx, { interactionHandlerType: InteractionHandlerTypes.Button });
  }

  public async run(interaction: ButtonInteraction, project: Project) {
    await interaction.reply({
      content: `The first project in TypeScript is called: ${project.name}`
    });
  }

  public async parse(interaction: ButtonInteraction) {
    if (interaction.customId !== 'awesome-typescript') return this.none();

    const dataFromDatabase = await this.container.prisma.project.findFirst({
      where: { projectLanguage: 'typescript' }
    });

    return this.some(dataFromDatabase);
  }
}
```

## The `ParseResult` utility type

:::info

This is for TypeScript users only. You may safely ignore this if you're not using TypeScript.

:::

There is a utility type on the InteractionHandler class called `ParseResult` that ensures whatever you return in your
parse method is what you'll get in the run method, with automatic updates! Here's how to do that:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { InteractionHandler, InteractionHandlerTypes, PieceContext } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { ButtonInteraction } from 'discord.js';

export class ParseResultExample extends InteractionHandler {
  public constructor(ctx: PieceContext, options: InteractionHandler.Options) {
    super(ctx, {
      ...options,
      interactionHandlerType: InteractionHandlerTypes.Button
    });
  }

  // Peep the `InteractionHandler.ParseResult`. It's the utility type you can use to ensure
  // that whatever you return in `parse` is what you get here, automagically! (works with Promises too!)
  public async run(interaction: ButtonInteraction, parsedData: InteractionHandler.ParseResult<this>): void {
    await interaction.reply({
      content: `Utility types are ${parsedData.awesome ? 'AWESOME!' : 'still awesome'}`
    });
  }

  public parse() {
    return this.some({ awesome: true });
  }
}
