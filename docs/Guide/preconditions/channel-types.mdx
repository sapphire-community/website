title: Setting the types of channel a command can run in
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Some commands are explicitly required to be executed on specific channels, on servers or also on private threads. In the
command options there is an option called `runIn` and it allows you to set on which type of channel the command should
be executed.

For example, we do not want the `!server-info` command to be executed through a DM channel, because your command code
would fail because it would not find the `guild` parameter in the `Message` property of your command. To solve this we
will assign the `runIn` option as `GUILD_TEXT`, and with this option the command will be executed only in server text
channels, but if you need the command can also be executed for example in threads, you can set the `runIn` option as
`GUILD_ANY`. Let's see an example of how we have to configure this option.

By default, this option is set to `null`, which means that it can be executed on DM channels as well as on any type of
server channel.

:::tip

You can see what kind of options the `runIn` option of the commands allows in the
[documentation](../../Documentation/api-framework/#commandoptionsruntype).
