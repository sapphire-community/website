title: Registering Chat Input Commands
---

A Chat Input Command can be registered to the Discord API by letting the command registry know about its existence. To
do so we need to use the [`registerApplicationCommands`][rac] to have access to the [`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][acr]
to perform operations on it. You can learn how to do this on the page
[`Acquiring an Application Command Registry`][aaacr].

## How to register a Chat Input Command

The easiest way to register a Chat Input Command is to implement the [`registerApplicationCommands`][rac] method on a
[`Command`][command] class. In that method the first parameter is the [`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][acr] (commonly
called `registry` in code) on which you can call [`registerChatInputCommand`][rcic]. This looks like:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{7,11-17}|{7,11-17}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class SlashCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      description: 'Send a Slash Command.'
    });
  }

  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: Command.Registry) {
    registry.registerChatInputCommand((builder) =>
      builder //
        .setName(this.name)
        .setDescription(this.description)
    );
  }

  public override chatInputRun(interaction: Command.ChatInputInteraction) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

:::info

We use `//` next to `builder //` here to short-circuit Prettier putting everything on the same line. If you do not use
prettier you can remove this, or if you do not care for it being on the same line then you can remove it.

:::

In this code snippet we have registered the Chat Input Command in the most simple way referencing the already defined
`name` and `description`. We also use the [`builder`][djs-slash-builder-docs] pattern which means you get verification
of your input before a command gets registered in a faulty way. It will also make sure that you are not providing
unnecessary or incorrect JSON keys because you're not building the JSON yourself. All that said, it is the method we
recommend everyone to use. If you are experienced with Chat Input Commands you can also opt to write your own raw JSON
object, however this guide will not cover that.

In the code snippet above we passed 1 parameter to the [`registerChatInputCommand`][rcic] method, to build the object
that gets send to Discord for registering the command. The [`registerChatInputCommand`][rcic] however also takes a
second parameter which we will cover next.

### Registering Chat Input Commands with options

Shown above is how to register a Chat Input Command without options, but in many cases you will actually want to receive
some data from the user, which is where options come in. Options are similar to the [Arguments][arguments] that Sapphire
offers for Message Commands, however they are built right into Discord.

In this example we will add an option that will prompt the user of the command to select another user that they want to
greet. This option is required and the command will not send at all if the option is not provided. This is really useful
as compared to Sapphire [Arguments][arguments] you no longer have to validate whether a required argument was provided
or not.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{16-21}|{16-21}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class SlashCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      description: 'Say hello to a user.'
    });
  }

  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: Command.Registry) {
    registry.registerChatInputCommand((builder) =>
      builder //
        .setName(this.name)
        .setDescription(this.description)
        .addUserOption((option) =>
          option //
            .setName('user')
            .setDescription('User to say hello to')
            .setRequired(true)
        )
    );
  }

  public override chatInputRun(interaction: Command.ChatInputInteraction) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

There are many other types of options that you can add to your Chat Input Command, and you can read all about them on
the [`discord.js guide`][djs-slash-builder-docs].

## Chat Input Command Registry Options

These are the meta options that is passed into the command registry for a Chat Input Command to control its behavior.
Let's take a look on them one by one.

### `idHints`

These are the unique command ids from the Discord API that the registry uses to identify the command in case you decide
to change the name of the command. Normally if you would change the name without providing [`idHints`][idhints] then a
new command would get registered, instead of overwriting the existing command. We therefore strongly recommend you to
specify the [`idHints`][idhints].

On top of the advantages in registering the command, having the ID of a command noted somewhere will also help you
identify the command elsewhere in your code, such as in [interaction handlers][interaction-handlers].

When Sapphire registers a application command it will log the command id for the command in console with the help of
default logger provided by `Sapphire`. The command ID is logged on the `info` level, which is the default, however, if
you have configured the Sapphire Logger to only log errors or fatal messages then please check
[`Configuring Log Level Guide`][configure-logging] to learn how to change it.

### `guildIds`

This is an array of guild ids for which the command should be registered. By default it is `undefined`, which means that
the command will be registered for all guilds (i.e. globally). If you want to register the command for a specific guild,
you can pass in the guild id in the command registry.

:::note

When the [`guildIds`][guildids] is an empty array the command will also be registered globally. This is useful for when
you're getting the [`guildIds`][guildids] from an external source, i.e. through a `getGuildIds` function. You can make
that external source default to an empty array which is often easier than `undefined`, especially when it comes from an
external source that using a difference programming language from JavaScript/TypeScript (i.e. an external API or
database).

:::

### `behaviorWhenNotIdentical`

This options tells the registry that how to behave when the command is not identical to the one which is already
registered on Discord API. By default it's set to [`OVERWRITE`][behavior-overwrite] which means that when there is a
difference between your local code and the Discord API then the data on the Discord API will get overwritten.

If you want the registry to only inform you about differences with logging, you can set this option to
[`LOG_TO_CONSOLE`][behavior-log].

### `registerCommandIfMissing`

This is an option that defaults to `true`. If set to `false`, the command will not be registered if it is not already
registered in the Discord API.

:::info

You will likely never have to touch this option, but it can be useful if you are not using Sapphire to register your
commands and instead you're using something external to do so.

## Chat Input Command Registry Methods

:::warning

To register a Chat Input Command, you need to acquire the [`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][acr]. Please see the
[`ApplicationCommandRegistry`][aaacr] section for more details.

:::

### `registerChatInputCommand`

The method which is responsible for telling the registry that this command should be registered. It takes two
parameters:

- `command`: The Chat Input Command data to be registered. This can be a `discord.js`
  [`ApplicationCommandData`][djs-command-data-docs] object a `@discordjs/builders`
  [`SlashCommandBuilder`][djs-slash-builder-docs] or a method which returns the `@discordjs/builders`
  [`SlashCommandBuilder`][djs-slash-builder-docs].

  For more details on how to use `@discordjs/builders `[`SlashCommandBuilder`][djs-slash-builder-docs], please see
  [`discord.js guide`][djs-slash-builder-docs].

- `options` These are optional registry [`options`][inner-ref-options] you can provide when registering the command you
  provided. By default, this is set to `{ behaviorWhenNotIdentical: RegisterBehavior.Overwrite }`.

An example of this method was shown above at [How to register a Chat Input Command][inner-ref-how-to].

### `addChatInputCommandNames`

The command names which let the registry know that these names should trigger the registry. These names doesn't register
the command but only let the registry know that these names should trigger the command, i.e. the names are only stored
in command store to be used by the registry. Names can be passed as strings.

### `addChatInputCommandIds`

The command ids that informs the registry to trigger it for the specified ids only. Ids can be passed as strings.

:::warning

`addChatInputCommandNames` or `addChatInputCommandIds` should only be used when you don't want `Sapphire` to manage the
application commands automatically for you else consider using `idHints` instead.

Whenever the `addChatInputCommandIds` method is called with an invalid id (we expect a string that can be turned into a
BigInt), then it will **ALWAYS** warn in the console. No, this cannot be turned off.

:::

## Full Example

Now that we have covered everything there is to registering a Chat Input Command lets look at how a full example could
look like. This builds on the examples provided above while also implementing the `chatInputRun` method to read the
option and send a response.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';
import { Formatters } from 'discord.js';

export class SlashCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      description: 'Say hello to a user.'
    });
  }

  public override registerApplicationCommands(registry: Command.Registry) {
    registry.registerChatInputCommand((builder) =>
      builder //
        .setName(this.name)
        .setDescription(this.description)
        .addUserOption((option) =>
          option //
            .setName('user')
            .setDescription('User to say hello to')
            .setRequired(true)
        )
    );
  }

  public override chatInputRun(interaction: Command.ChatInputInteraction) {
    const userToGreet = interaction.options.getUser('user', true);

    const userToGreetMention = Formatters.userMention(userToGreet.id);
    const interactionUserMention = Formatters.userMention(interaction.user.id);

    return interaction.reply({
      content: `Hey ${userToGreetMention}, ${interactionUserMention} says hello!`,
      allowedMentions: {
        users: [userToGreet.id, interaction.user.id]
      }
    });
  }
}
```
