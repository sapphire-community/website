title: Using and extending `container`
---

## Using container:

The container can be used to access your custom properties, or the ones attached by the framework (like the client).
Suppose you want to access the client in a file where you don't extend a sapphire piece (like commands, listeners,
etc.), meaning you can't access `container` from `this`, you can manually import the container from the framework and
access your client:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { container } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class ExampleClass {
  public run() {
    const { client } = container;
    // rest of your code
  }
}
```

## Extending container:

You can attach your custom properties to the container, as mentioned above, to access them in your code:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import { container } from '@sapphire/framework';

container.property = 'value';

declare module '@sapphire/pieces' {
  interface container {
    property: string;
  }
}

console.log(container.property); // value
```

The above code attaches `property` to the container with the value `value`, and then augments the `@sapphire/pieces`
module to add `property` to the container interface, this is a simple example to demonstrate how you can attach
properties to the container.
