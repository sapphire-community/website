:::tip
They can be used anytime with the `Args` class, and can be accessed via `container.stores.get('arguments')`.

:::caution Overriding
If you define an `Argument` with the same name as a built-in one, e.g. `boolean`, the one you define will replace the built-in one. This same mechanism applies to all other stores from the framework and plugins.
