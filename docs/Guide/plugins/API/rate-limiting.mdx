title: Applying rate limits to routes
sidebar_position: 7

When writing an API that is publicly available for consumption, it is often desirable to set a rate limit on your routes
to ensure they cannot be abused. This is especially true when you are developing an API that is intended to be consumed
by a large number of users. On this page we will guide you to write your own rate limiter that integrates with Sapphire.

The first step to creating a rate limiter is create an instance of `RateLimitManager`. This manager has to be created on
a per-route basis, so it is advisable to create it as a class property or constant in the file of the route.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{6,8}|{6,8}
import { methods, Route } from '@sapphire/plugin-api';
import { Time } from '@sapphire/time-utilities';
import { RateLimitManager } from '@sapphire/ratelimits';

export class UserRoute extends Route {
  private timeForRateLimit = Time.Second * 5;

  private readonly rateLimitManager = new RateLimitManager(Time.Second * 5, 1);

  public constructor(context: Route.Context, options: Route.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      route: 'hello-world'
    });
  }

  public [methods.GET](request: ApiRequest, response: ApiResponse) {
    response.json({ message: 'Hello World' });
  }
}
```

The next step is to create a function that will tell us whether the user is to be rate limited or not:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs
import type { ApiRequest, ApiResponse } from '@sapphire/plugin-api';
import type { RateLimitManager } from '@sapphire/ratelimits';
import { isNullish, isNullishOrZero } from '@sapphire/utilities';

interface RateLimitParameters {
  /** The time in milliseconds that the rate limit is set to */
  time: number;
  /** The API request that this rate limit is checking against */
  request: ApiRequest;
  /** The API response that will be sent to the user */
  response: ApiResponse;
  /** The {@link RateLimitManager} for this route */
  manager: RateLimitManager;
  /** Whether the user needs to be authenticated for this route or not */
  auth?: boolean;
}

/**
 * Checks whether a user should be rate limited.
 * @param param0 The parameters for this function
 * @returns `true` if the user should be rate limited, `false` otherwise
 */
export function isRateLimited({ time, request, response, manager, auth = false }: RateLimitParameters) {
  if (isNullishOrZero(time) || isNullish(request) || isNullish(response) || isNullish(manager)) {
    return false;
  }

  const id = (auth ? request.auth!.id : request.headers['x-api-key'] || request.socket.remoteAddress) as string;
  const bucket = manager.acquire(id);

  response.setHeader('Date', new Date().toUTCString());
  response.setHeader('X-RateLimit-Limit', time);
  response.setHeader('X-RateLimit-Remaining', bucket.remaining.toString());
  response.setHeader('X-RateLimit-Reset', bucket.remainingTime.toString());

  if (bucket.limited) {
    response.setHeader('Retry-After', bucket.remainingTime.toString());
    return true;
  }

  try {
    bucket.consume();
  } catch {}

  return false;
}
```

:::info

Lets explain what this function does.

First of all we get the `id`. If the user needs to be authenticated for this route it will be their authentication
token, if they don't it will be the header `x-api-key`, or their IP address.

Now that we have the `id` we can retrieve the rate limiting bucket for that `id`. The [`RateLimitManager`][rlm] uses the
`id` to keep track of any requests from that `id`. Note that if you want to apply one rate limiting for **all** routes
for the same user, then be sure to create the instance of `RateLimitManager` outside of the API route.

Next we check if the bucket is limited. If it is, we set the `Retry-After` header to the remaining time in the bucket.
If it is not then we consume the bucket, and set the `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and
`X-RateLimit-Reset` headers to inform users about the eventual rate limit.

If the user is being rate limited then this function returns `true`, and if not then it returns `false`. We can use this
in an `if` check in the route to change the response behaviour, as seen below.

Finally we can put this all together:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{19-28}
import { ApiRequest, ApiResponse, HttpCodes, methods, Route } from '@sapphire/plugin-api';
import { Time } from '@sapphire/time-utilities';
import { RateLimitManager } from '@sapphire/ratelimits';
import { isRateLimited } from '../lib/api/utils'; // Example, you can put the function anywhere you want.

export class UserRoute extends Route {
  private timeForRateLimit = Time.Second * 5;

  private readonly rateLimitManager = new RateLimitManager(Time.Second * 5, 1);

  public constructor(context: Route.Context, options: Route.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      route: 'hello-world'
    });
  }

  public [methods.GET](request: ApiRequest, response: ApiResponse) {
    if (
      isRateLimited({
        time: this.timeForRateLimit,
        request,
        response,
        manager: this.rateLimitManager
      })
    ) {
      return response.error(HttpCodes.TooManyRequests);
    }

    response.json({ message: 'Hello World' });
  }
}
```

Now when a user gets rate limited they will receive a 429 error with a Retry-After header.
