title: Setting the types of channel a command can run in
---

The [`runIn`][runin] command option can be used to specify the types of channels a command can run in. This can be
useful if you're developing a command that, for example, displays the roles of a user. In that scenario, you'll want to
make sure that the command can only be run in guild channels.

:::info

You can view the valid `runIn` values [here][runintypes].

:::

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{7}|{7}
import { Command, CommandOptionsRunTypeEnum } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.LoaderContext) {
    super(context, {
      // ...
      runIn: CommandOptionsRunTypeEnum.GuildAny // Only run in guild channels
    });
  }
}
```

If you try to run a command in direct messages, you'll now find that nothing happens.

:::tip

To learn how to send a message to the command executor when a precondition fails, see [Reporting Precondition
Failure][reporting-precondition-failure].
