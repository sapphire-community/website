title: Using arguments in your commands
---

:::warning

This section is only for the message command and is not relevant for the other command types. If you are looking for how
to use arguments in your `Slash command` then please refer to the [`discord.js guide`][djs-slash-guide-options] about
adding options to your command.

:::

Often when using commands, you may want to get data from the user and change the response accordingly. In this section,
we'll demonstrate how to create a command that pulls a string from the message and echoes it back to the user!

## String arguments

A `string` argument is any textual data after the command's invocation. For example, in `@bot say Hello!`, `Hello!`
would be the first string argument; however, note that multiple words (e.g. `Hello there!`) are separated individually
into multiple arguments. We'll look into how to handle those later.

In your `commands` folder, make a new file called `echo.js` and set up the command class just like the one in the `ping`
command.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{4-10}|{5-11}
import { Command, Args } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';

export class EchoCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      aliases: ['parrot', 'copy'],
      description: 'Replies with the text you provide'
    });
  }

  public async messageRun(message: Message, args: Args) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

We have a new parameter in the `messageRun` method: `args`! This is a structure that abstracts all the argument parsing
and resolution.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{4}|{5}
import { Command, Args } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';

export class EchoCommand extends Command {
  public async messageRun(message: Message, args: Args) {
    const text = await args.pick('string');
    await message.channel.send(text);
  }
}
```

Sapphire's arguments work by consuming the delimited elements of user input one by one upon success, similar to how an
[iterator] works. We'll go into more details and examples in another command.

In this command, [`args.pick('<type>')`][pick] is used to read a single argument from the user's input. The `<type>`
here is `string`, so it'll return the argument as-is since all data in a message's body is textual.

If `@bot say Hello there!` is sent, it'll return `Hello` since each word is split into its own argument as
aforementioned, so `Hello there!` is converted to `['Hello', 'there!']` but [`args.pick()`][pick] only reads one
argument. However, there are alternatives:

- **Quoted arguments**: If the argument content is quoted, e.g. `"Hello there!"` or `“Hello there!”` instead of
  `Hello there!`, the entire argument (excluding the quotes) will be read as one.

- **[`args.rest()`][rest], such as**:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{7,12}|{8,13}
import { Command, Args } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';

export class EchoCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      quotes: []
    });
  }

  public async messageRun(message: Message, args: Args) {
    const text = await args.rest('string');
    await message.channel.send(text);
  }
}
```

By default, `Command` defines 4 pairs of valid quotes:

- `"` and `"` (double quotes)
- `“` and `”` (iOS smart quotes)
- `「` and `」` (CJK corner brackets)
- `«` and `»` (French Quotes)

This is troublesome if you want to allow sending quotes within the content, as those would be excluded from `rest`, so
`quotes` must be set to an empty array. This way, when `@bot echo Hello "there!"` is sent, your bot will reply with
`Hello "there!"`.

:::caution

[`args.rest()`][rest] consumes all the arguments and then processes them, so you will not be able to consume any more
arguments after it.

:::

## Multiple arguments

Let's make an `add` command, which takes two numbers and adds them. Create an `add.js` file in your `commands` folder
and set up the command class again. Since two arguments are needed, use [`args.pick()`][pick] twice:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{12-14}|{13-15}
import { Command, Args } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';

export class MathsCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      description: 'Adds two numbers'
    });
  }

  public async messageRun(message: Message, args: Args) {
    const a = await args.pick('number');
    const b = await args.pick('number');
    return message.channel.send(`The result is ${a + b}!`);
  }
}
```

Each time [`args.pick('<type>')`][pick] is called, it consumes the next argument and parses it as the `<type>` given, so
`@bot add 1 2` would return `The result is 3!` for instance.

## Optional arguments

Sapphire offers two options regarding optional arguments. Let's make a `pow.js` command that takes two numbers, where
the `base` is required, and the `exponent` defaults to 2.

- **Optional Pattern**

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{6}|{7}
import { Command, Args } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';

export class MathsCommand extends Command {
  public async messageRun(message: Message, args: Args) {
    const base = await args.pick('number');
    const exponent = await args.pick('number').catch(() => 2);
    return message.channel.send(`The result is ${Math.pow(base, exponent)}!`);
  }
}
```

Since `exponent` defaults to `2`, this allows users to send `@bot pow 4`, returning `The result is 16!`. However, this
pattern ignores any possible errors, including invalid numbers, so `@bot pow 4 hello!` would return the same response as
before. There is another pattern that enables you to use optional arguments but retain error reporting:

- **Semi-required Pattern**

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{6}|{7}
import { Command, Args } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';

export class MathsCommand extends Command {
  public async messageRun(message: Message, args: Args) {
    const base = await args.pick('number');
    const exponent = args.finished ? 2 : await args.pick('number');
    return message.channel.send(`The result is ${Math.pow(base, exponent)}!`);
  }
}
```

This is slightly more verbose, but it only uses the default value for `exponent` of `2` if there were no arguments left
to parse, so `@bot pow 4` will return `The result is 16!`, while `@bot pow 4 hello!` will return an error.

Each pattern has its use-cases. The former is especially helpful for handling several optional arguments, although you
can also distinguish all errors by checking `error.identifier`. This way you can tell why something failed to parse, for
instance, a number may fail to parse if the user did not provide a valid number.

## Repeating arguments

To work with repeating arguments, you can use [`args.repeat()`][repeat], which works like [`args.pick()`][pick] but
returns an array of parsed elements, resolving when it can validate at least the first argument.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{5}|{6}
import { Command, Args } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';

export class MathsCommand extends Command {
  public async messageRun(message: Message, args: Args) {
    const numbers = await args.repeat('number');
    return message.channel.send(`The highest number is ${Math.max(...numbers)}!`);
  }
}
```

Sapphire will try to parse all the arguments until there are none left to consume or one fails to parse. As such, the
following inputs will yield the following results:

- `@bot max 42 2 5 60 3` will return `The highest number is 60!`.
- `@bot max aa 42 2 5 6` will throw an error as it cannot parse `aa` to a number.
- `@bot max 42 2 5 aa 60` will return `The highest number is 42!`. The `60` is not included because it stopped parsing
  at `aa`.

While the last case seems restrictive, it can be used to parse repeated arguments at any given position in the user's
input. For example, a `ban` command that takes multiple users could be written as:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{12}|{13}
import { Command, Args } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';

export class MathsCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      description: 'Adds two numbers'
    });
  }

  public async messageRun(message: Message, args: Args) {
    const members = await args.repeat('member');
    const reason = args.finished ? null : args.rest('string');

    // ...
  }
}
```

The code above allows the following uses:

- `@bot ban @User1 Hello there` (`members` is `[User1]` and `reason` is `'Hello there'`).
- `@bot ban @User1 @User2` (`members` is `[User1, User2]` and `reason` is `null`).
- `@bot ban Hello there` throws an error as it could not match a member.

Additionally, we can tell the argument parser how many times it should parse at most by specifying `times` when we call
[`args.repeat()`][repeat]:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{12}|{13}
import { Command, Args } from '@sapphire/framework';
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';

export class MathsCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.Context, options: Command.Options) {
    super(context, {
      ...options,
      description: 'Adds two numbers'
    });
  }

  public async messageRun(message: Message, args: Args) {
    const members = await args.repeat('member', { times: 5 });
    // ...
  }
}
```

The code above matches any number of members up to 5, so it will never return an array of 6 or more.
