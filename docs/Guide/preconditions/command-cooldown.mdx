title: Configuring command cooldowns
---

Cooldowns are of vital importance for many bots to avoid excessive command usage, API ratelimits, and so on. Luckily,
Sapphire makes it easy to integrate them into your commands! At its simplest level, cooldowns can be used in specific
commands via the [`cooldownDelay`][cooldowndelay] property in the command's options. This value is amount of
milliseconds that a user will have to wait after using a command to use it again. Here's a basic example:

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{7}|{7}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.LoaderContext) {
    super(context, {
      // ...
      cooldownDelay: 10_000 // 10_000 milliseconds (10 seconds)
    });
  }
}
```

If you now try to run this command, and then run it again within 10_000 milliseconds (10 seconds), the command won't
execute, and an error will be thrown. You can learn how to process that error [here][reporting-precondition-failure].

:::info

`cooldownDelay` only accepts a value of milliseconds, which is not known to be the easiest to read or calculate. To
help, you can use [@sapphire/time-utilities][timeutils], which includes utilities for time transformers.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{8}|{8}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';
import { Time } from '@sapphire/time-utilities';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.LoaderContext) {
    super(context, {
      // ...
      cooldownDelay: Time.Second * 10 // Much easier for humans to read
    });
  }
}
```

You can view the docs [here][timeenum].

## User Exceptions

It's very common to not want cooldowns to apply to certain people, for example, the bot owner. This can be achieved by
adding [`cooldownFilteredUsers`][cooldownfilteredusers] to the options. This option should be an array of users ID that
the bot can ignore when calculating cooldowns.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{8}|{8}
import { Command } from '@sapphire/framework';

export class PingCommand extends Command {
  public constructor(context: Command.LoaderContext) {
    super(context, {
      // ...
      cooldownDelay: 10_000 // 10_000 milliseconds (10 seconds)
      cooldownFilteredUsers: ['YOUR_ID'] // Ignore the bot owner
    });
  }
}
```

## Advanced Usage

Accompanying `cooldownDelay`, you also have access to the options [`cooldownLimit`][cooldownlimit] and
[`cooldownScope`][cooldownscope].

`cooldownLimit` will define how many times a command can be used before a cooldown is put into affect. This value is set
to `1` by default. For example, a `cooldownDelay` of `10_000` milliseconds and a `cooldownLimit` of 2 will effectively
mean that you'd be able to use the command twice every 10 seconds.

Another useful option is `cooldownScope`, which will define the scope of the cooldown. This is useful if you want to
have a cooldown that applies per guild, for example, instead of per user. Valid scopes can be found [here][scopes].

## Client-wide Cooldowns

Sometimes you'll find a use case where you want specific cooldown options to apply to all commands in your client. This
can be achieved by adding [`defaultCooldown`][defaultcooldown] to your [`SapphireClient`][sapphire] options. You can use
any of the properties shown above with this option.

```typescript ts2esm2cjs|{5-10}
import { SapphireClient, BucketScope } from '@sapphire/framework';

const client = new SapphireClient({
  intents: ['GUILDS', 'GUILD_MESSAGES'],
  defaultCooldown: {
    delay: 10_000, // 10_000 milliseconds
    filteredCommands: ['ping'], // Ignore the `ping` command
    filteredUsers: ['YOUR_ID'], // Ignore the bot owner
    limit: 2, // Allow 2 uses before ratelimiting
    scope: BucketScope.Channel // Scope cooldown to channel
  }
});

void client.login('your-token-goes-here');
```
